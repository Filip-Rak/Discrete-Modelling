# Overview
This repository contains solutions to various exercises for the **Discrete Modelling** course during the fifth semester at **AGH University of Krakow**. The exercises involve implementing different computational models and simulations in **Python** and **C++**, covering topics such as **image processing**, **cellular automata**, and **fluid simulations**.
